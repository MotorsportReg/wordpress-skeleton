# Wordpress Skeleton

A baseline wordpress setup designed for any motorsport club, race track or sanctioning body to use freely. The design and development of this template was funded by the San Francisco Region of the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and managed by Brian Ghidinelli from MotorsportReg.com.

This repo includes a responsive theme designed for mobile devices, a collection of high-quality plugins commonly required and a starter database backup. The backup includes the most common pages required for driving and social events such as:

 * Club racing
 * Time Trials
 * Track days / High Performance Driving School / HPDE
 * Autocross / Autoslalom
 * Rallycross
 * Rally
 * Fun runs / Driving Tours
 * Karting
 * Motorcycles
 * Boats, snowmobiles, lawn mowers, you name it...

Simply rename or delete the pages you don't need, edit the starter copy, add your own photos and you'll have a nice looking, easy-to-update website that lists your events and builds your email list. We'll be adding simple how-to documentation here to help you keep your members and participants up to date.
